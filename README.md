# ClusterAnalyseEuroStat
This is a project I developed when I studied the clustering classes in CNAM (Conservatoire National des arts et métiers).
The data used in this analysis is from the open data portail: Eurostat.
A set of datasets have been joined to this analysis: income, population, education, health ...
The objective of this analysis to define the épanouissement clusters among countries in Europe.
For final demo, please look at the file "projet_final.html".
